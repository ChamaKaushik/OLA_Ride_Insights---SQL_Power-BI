# Ola Ride Insights 🚖📊

## 📌 Project Overview

The Ola Ride Insights project focuses on analyzing ride-sharing data from Ola to uncover meaningful business insights. Using SQL for querying and Power BI for visualization, the project highlights booking trends, cancellations, customer ratings, revenue distribution, and more.

The goal is to improve decision-making by providing clear, data-driven insights into customer behavior, driver performance, and operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Ride-hailing platforms like Ola generate vast amounts of booking data. However, transforming this raw data into actionable insights is challenging. This project addresses the following:

- Identifying demand patterns and booking trends.
- Understanding cancellations (both by drivers and customers).
- Analyzing revenue streams and payment methods.
- Tracking customer and driver ratings.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** – Querying, aggregation, filtering, and data analysis.
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and visualizations.

📂 Dataset

- Dataset: OLA_Dataset (ride booking records).
- Key columns: booking_id, customer_id, vehicle_type, booking_status, payment_method, ride_distance, booking_value, customer_rating, driver_rating.

## 📝 SQL Insights

Sample queries written in SQL include:
1. Retrieve all successful bookings.
2. Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type.
3. Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers.
4. List the top 5 customers with the highest number of rides.
5. Find maximum & minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings.
6. Retrieve rides paid via UPI.
7. Calculate total booking value of successful rides.
8. List incomplete rides with reasons.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboards

Key visualizations built in Power BI:
- **Ride Volume Over Time** – Track booking trends by date.
- **Booking Status Breakdown** – Success vs cancellations (by driver & customer).
- **Revenue by Payment Method** – Cash, UPI, Credit/Debit cards.
- **Top 5 Customers** – Based on total booking value.
- **Ride Distance Distribution Per Day.**
- **Ratings** – Customer vs Driver ratings comparison.
- **Cancellation Reasons** – Customer-related vs driver-related.
